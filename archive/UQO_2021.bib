@article{Tham2020,
abstract = {A fully homomorphic encryption system hides data from unauthorized parties, while still allowing them to perform computations on the encrypted data. Aside from the straightforward benefit of allowing users to delegate computations to a more powerful server without revealing their inputs, a fully homomorphic cryptosystem can be used as a building block in the construction of a number of cryptographic functionalities. Designing such a scheme remained an open problem until 2009, decades after the idea was first conceived, and the past few years have seen the generalization of this functionality to the world of quantum machines. Quantum schemes prior to the one implemented here were able to replicate some features in particular use-cases often associated with homomorphic encryption but lacked other crucial properties, for example, relying on continual interaction to perform a computation or leaking information about the encrypted data. We present the first experimental realisation of a quantum fully homomorphic encryption scheme. We further present a toy two-party secure computation task enabled by our scheme. Finally, as part of our implementation, we also demonstrate a post-selective two-qubit linear optical controlled-phase gate with a much higher post-selection success probability (1/2) when compared to alternate implementations, e.g. with post-selective controlled-$Z$ or controlled-$X$ gates (1/9).},

@article{Pang2020,
abstract = {The de Broglie-Bohm theory is a hidden-variable interpretation of quantum mechanics which involves particles moving through space along deterministic trajectories. This theory singles out position as the primary ontological variable. Mathematically, it is possible to construct a similar theory where particles are moving through momentum-space, and momentum is singled out as the primary ontological variable. In this paper, we construct the putative particle trajectories for a two-slit experiment in both the position and momentum-space theories by simulating particle dynamics with coherent light. Using a method for constructing trajectories in the primary and non-primary spaces, we compare the phase-space dynamics offered by the two theories and show that they do not agree. This contradictory behaviour underscores the difficulty of selecting one picture of reality from the infinite number of possibilities offered by Bohm-like theories.},

@article{Goktas2020,
abstract = {The first generation of small noisy quantum processors have recently become available to non-specialists who are not required to understand specifics of the physical platforms and, in particular, the types and sources of noise. As such, it is useful to benchmark the performance of such computers against specific tasks that may be of interest to users, ideally keeping both the circuit depth and width as free parameters. Here, we benchmark the IBM quantum experience using the deterministic quantum computing with 1 qubit (DQC1) algorithm originally proposed by Knill and Laflamme in the context of liquid-state NMR. In the first set of experiments, we use DQC1 as a trace estimation algorithm to benchmark performance with respect to circuit depth. In the second set, we use this trace estimation algorithm to distinguish between knots, a classically difficult task which is known to be complete for DQC1. Our results indicate that the main limiting factor is the depth of the circuit and that both random and systematic errors become an issue when the gate count increases. Surprisingly, we find that at the same gate count wider circuits perform better, probably due to randomization of coherent errors.},

  abstract = {The application of a matrix-based reconstruction protocol for obtaining Molecular Frame (MF) photoelectron angular distributions (MFPADs) from laboratory frame (LF) measurements (LFPADs) is explored. Similarly to other recent works on the topic of MF reconstruction, this protocol makes use of time-resolved LF measurements, in which a rotational wavepacket is prepared and probed via photoionization, followed by a numerical reconstruction routine; however, in contrast to other methodologies, the protocol developed herein does not require determination of photoionization matrix elements, and consequently takes a relatively simple numerical form (matrix transform making use of the Moore-Penrose inverse). Significantly, the simplicity allows application of the method to the successful reconstruction of MFPADs for polyatomic molecules. The scheme is demonstrated numerically for two realistic cases, \$N\_2\$ and \$C\_2H\_4\$. The new technique is expected to be generally applicable for a range of MF reconstruction problems involving photoionization of polyatomic molecules.},

abstract = {Wavelength-tunable, time-locked pairs of ultrafast pulses are crucial in modern-day time-resolved measurements. We demonstrate a simple means of generating configurable optical pulse sequences: sub-picosecond pulses are carved out from a continuous wave laser via pump-induced optical Kerr switching in 10\&\#x2009;cm of a commercial single-mode fiber. By introducing dispersion to the pump, the near transform-limited switched pulse duration is tuned between 305\&\#x2013;570\&\#x2009;fs. Two- and four-pulse signal trains are also generated by adding birefringent \&\#x03B1;-BBO plates in the pump beam. These results highlight an ultrafast light source with intrinsic timing stability and pulse-to-pulse phase coherence, where pulse generation could be adapted to wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet to infrared.},
